Generate and implement using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, following these guidelines:
1. Use MVVM architecture with a multi-module setup (:app, :data, :domain, :ui).
2. Follow Kotlin coding conventions (immutability, sealed classes, safe null handling).
3. Use Hilt for dependency injection, with clear module definitions.
4. Implement robust error handling with Result types and Timber logging ".
5. Write modular, reusable composables with state managed in ViewModels.
6. Organize code by feature (e.g., com.example.app.feature.user).
7. Include unit tests for ViewModels and Repositories using JUnit and Mockito.
8. Add KDoc for public APIs and concise comments for complex logic.
9. Ensure linting with ktlint and Android lint rules.
10. Log errors with stack traces in debug builds and user-friendly messages in the UI.
